# RTC DS1307 (Clock Module)

Whether you’re building a digital clock, logging sensor data with timestamps, or automating something based on time of day, you’ll need a way to track time accurately.

The DS3231 can keep track of seconds, minutes, hours, days, dates, months, and years. 

You can set up the chip to show time in either 12-hour format (with AM/PM indicators) or 24-hour format. The chip also includes two programmable alarms that can go off at specific times during the day.
